Before Running anything , remember to run

```
npm i
```
to install all the modules , for both frontend and backend after you have cd over to each directory individually
• For backend you'll need to start mongod on your terminal as well on port 127.0.0.1:27017
• Install all the modules as well before running frontend/backend
• Run backend as well to fetch live data
